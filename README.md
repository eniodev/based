  <h1>The Based Stack</h1>
</div>

`Based` is the hottest frontend stack for web development!

This stack is made of 3 main technologies:

+ [`HTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML): also known as the super hot HyperText Markup Language
+ [`CSS`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS): the most used technology for styling web pages
+ [`JavaScript`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript): for many, the best programming language in the world

I know, right? Completely *based*!

## Why based?

You don't need React, Angular or Vue to build a simple website. Keep it simple, stupid!

## Prerequisites

+ [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (`version => 14.21.3`)

## Installation

Run the command below to install `based` command line on your machine:

```console
$ npm install create-based-app --global
```

## Getting started

Run the command below to start a new project:

```console
$ create-based-app <project-name>
```

Ater that, the file tree of your project could look like this:

```
<project-name>
├── assets
│   └── images
├── styles
│   └── index.css
├── index.html
└── scripts
    └── index.js
```
## Will you have to refresh the browser to see any changes?

NO! We highly recommend the use of [`live-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) as it will automatically refresh the browser for you when changes occur in your files

Just install it:

```console
$ npm install live-server --global
```
And run it inside your project root folder:

```console
$ live-server
```

Now you can start building on the web, no need for garbage frameworks :)
